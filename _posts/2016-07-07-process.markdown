The process that the data follows is the one shown in the diagram:

1. The tweets are collected.
2. URL Filter: the tweets are filtered excluding the ones that don't include an URL.
3. Lang Filter: the tweets are filtered by language and then separated in two groups: tweets in Spanish and tweets in English (lang_filter_ES and lang_filter_EN).
4. Near Duplicates filter: each group are filtered again in order to exclude their duplicates and near duplicates.
5. Features Exractor: the features of each tweet are extracted, saving them into a JSON file:
	* Features from the tweets.
	* Scrapper: Features from their URLs.
6. Model: the features are processed by the training model.
7. Front End:
