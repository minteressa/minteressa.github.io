1. The tweets collected are filtered excluding the ones that don't include an URL.
2. The tweets that include an URL are filtered by language and then separated in two groups: tweets in Spanish and tweets in English.
3. Each group are filtered again in order to excude their duplicates and near duplicates.
4. Feature extraction, saving the into a JSON file:
	* From the tweets.
	* From their URLs using web scrapping.
5. Vectorization of the extracted features.
6. The features are processed by the training model.
